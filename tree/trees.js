// a tree is a data structure that consist of nodes in a parent/child relationship
// threes are nonlinear- we can take many different paths


// root - top node in a tree
// child - a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
// parent - a node directly connected to another node when moving toward the root
// siblings -  group of nodes with the same parent
// leaf - node with no childen
// edge - connection between one node and another


// trees applications:
// HTML DOM
// Network routing
// abstract syntax tree (way of describing syntax of  programming language)
// AI & machine learning
// folders in oparating systems
