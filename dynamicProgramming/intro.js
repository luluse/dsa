// definition 
//method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just one and storing their solutions

// using past knowledge to make solving a future problem easier

// this technique cannot solve all problems, but very efficient on the problems it can solve

// we can use dynamic programming on problems wih optimal structure and overlapping subproblems

// overlapping subproblems
// a problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broen down into subproblems which are reused several times

// optimal structure
// a problem is said to have optimal structure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
